## Introduction

This project is a custom game engine designed to handle text-based adventures and modular game mechanics. Built using **TypeScript** for type safety and scalability, along with **Express.js** for a robust and flexible API, this engine provides a powerful backend to manage game logic, player interactions, and game states.

## Features

- Modular game logic for text-based adventures.
- API for managing game states, players, and game actions.
- Real-time interaction between players and game mechanics.
- Scalable architecture allowing for easy addition of new features and game types.
- **TypeScript** for strong typing and better developer experience.
- **Express.js** API for fast, secure, and flexible server-side functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)**: Ensures type-safe code for better maintainability.
- **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)**: Manages API endpoints and server-side logic.
- **Node.js**: The runtime for building scalable network applications.
- **SQL/NoSQL Databases**: For storing game states and user data.
- **RESTful API**: For seamless communication between client and server.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/game-engine.git
    cd game-engine
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Configure your `.env` file with the necessary environment variables (API keys, database connection, etc.).

## Getting Started

### Running the Development API

Start the development API server:

```bash
npm run dev-api
```
Running the Development Web Server
In another terminal, start the development web server:

```bash
npm run dev-web
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## API Routes

API routes can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api). These endpoints manage game logic, player actions, and other server-side interactions.
